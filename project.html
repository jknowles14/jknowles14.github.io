        <article class="intro">
          <p>Stacks is a cloud storage website for the everyday user. For this project, I was a generalist and took on everything from research, user testing, branding design, and UX/UI design. The tools I used were Invision, Figma, Google forms and
            Usabilityhub. </p>

        <article class="problem">
          <p>Problem - The client didn’t have a clear vision in mind, but they did want to create a place to save content from the web, organize that content, upload files, and share large files/multiple files. </p>
        </article>
        <article class="solution">
          <p> Solution - To create a secure space that’s easy to share individual files or whole folders, either by link or email. You also have the option to password protect links. Large files are easy to save and share with up to 10TB of free
            space, with the option to pay for more space if it’s needed.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>I compared Google Drive, Evernote and, Dropbox. This analysis helped me take the best parts of each product to include in my own. Evernote’s ability to tag files for later searches. Google’s large amount of free storage. Dropbox’s
            streamlined and easy to use service, their ability to share with non-users, and ability to create passwords when sharing. A weakness of one application was a strength for another. </p>

          <h2>User Survey</h2>
          <p> A user survey was created and 100% of those surveyed used Cloud Storage and/or organization websites and applications. Next, I looked at what users liked about the current Cloud storage they were using. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle;"> Cons:
            <li>Difficult to track what and when things are shared </li>
            <li>Storage space is limited and I don’t like paying for the additional</li>
            <li>It could be hacked</li>
            <li>No Subfile organization</li>

            <li> The easy share and modify of documents with teams /clients /friends /family </li>
            <li> Easier send to multiple people</li>
            <li> Easier to send large files</li>

          <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p>When comparing personal and work use, over 75% use these products for work and 90% use for personal reasons. The personas synthesized what I’ve learned about the users and how the products could be used in their day-to-day lives. This
            especially useful because the client didn’t have a target audience. </p>

          <h2>User Stories, Flows, and Wireframes</h2>
          <p>User stories were needed to help me focus in on the tasks that were important to include in the most viable product and to create User Flows. Then Wireframes were then created to begin the rough design and layout of the website. </p>

          <h2>High Fidelity Mockups</h2>
          <p>When working on the High Fidelity Mockups, I realized that my landing page was bare and I needed to extend it and add more information for the user. More buttons were added to give the user more chances to sign up or log in.</p>

        <article class="pref">
          <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
          <p> Preference testing to help me decide what worked best for the users. I wanted to make sure that items were still easy to read with an image background or if users prefer no background image on those pages. For the hero image (above),
            77% of testers preferred the image of the stack of books to the side. Giving reasons like “it's cleaner” and “makes sense with the website’s name”. </p>

        </div>
        <article class="dash">
          <p>For the dashboard (above), 62% preferred that it not have a background image giving reasons like “cleaner”, “less busy”, “easier to read”. Without preference testing, I would have left the background image on the dashboard and the
            inside a folder pages because that’s what I prefer. Also, the preference test for the hero image helps me feel secure in my choice of image. I
            was
            happy that there was a clear winner in all the preference tests. This made me feel confident in the needed changes. </p>

          <h2>Branding </h2>
          <p>The name Stacks came about when thinking of a place you share information and images, like the library, but a library is a serious place and I wanted something more playful than that. The stacks are the back of the library where the
            scientific and architecture books are piled. It’s also a place you might slip off to for a moment alone with someone else for a conversation or something more. It’s a place that’s real but has almost mythic other meaning. </p>
        </article>
        <img src="images/moodboard.jpg" alt="Stacks Moodboard" class="moodboard" />
        <article class="mood">
          <p> I used a mood board to help me come up with a color scheme. I knew that I wanted it to be colorful like a pile of books usually is. Stacks is blue for intelligence and trustworthiness and its red for passion and creativity. I found
            further inspiration from a Russian website Creddy that I found on Land-book. It used the colors that I wanted but executed them in a safe way that was less intense than the original colors I had in mind.

          <h2>User testing </h2>
          <p>User testing results showed that the website was easy to navigate. It also revealed what I need to keep or change. I needed to fix how users were adding a tag because 100% of users were confused where the tags were. All three hesitated
            before using the plus sign to add a tag. Two of the participants tried to add the tag the same way you would add a file. To fix this I decided to make the “Tags” title larger, the tags themselves larger and “+” icon next to the tags
            larger. Everything was moved up higher too. </p>

        <article>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>From conception to completion Stacks has gone through a lot of changes. Through user testing, I found that the background images I wanted wouldn’t work because it made the files hard to read. I also learned that the way I had created
            tags
            was difficult for users to spot. Also, I made changes to the taskbar and some of the layout. I made an adjustment to the fonts that I used and to my logo to make them more stylish and easier to read. Taking a vague concept and turning it
            into a tangible website was at times overwhelming, but I enjoyed working on Stacks and making something that was easy to use, clean and minimalistic.</p>
