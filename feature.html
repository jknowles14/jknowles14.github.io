          <p>There’s a lot left to be desired in the apps made for stretching, they’re currently made for dancers or combine workouts with stretches. The goal of “Bendable” was to design an app where the user could easily choose a stretching routine
            based on areas of the body, have short routines that people really have time for and stretches the average person could do. </p>

          <p> <strong> Problem </strong> - </p>
          <br>
          <p> Most people say that they would like to stretch more, but only 5% of survey users had ever used a stretching app. The apps currently on the market are made for people with advanced flexibility, lacks focus by combining stretches and
            workouts, or expects the user to commit a lot of time. </p>
        </article>
        <article class="solution">
          <p> <strong> Solution </strong> - </p>
          <br>
          <p> 100% of users wanted to improve their flexibility. The solution is to engage the 95% (that had never used a stretch app) by designing an app so easy to use, that when looking at an outline of a body, you can just point and tap where
            you want to stretch. Including multiple routines per body region and short routines that people have time for. </p>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>Three highly rated stretching apps were compared: “Stretching Exercise App”, “Splits in 30 days”, and “StretchIt”. All three took a very different approach. Combined strengths of these apps include teaching the stretch with thorough
            instruction, strong social media pages, challenging stretches and focusing on one goal. Weaknesses include: combining workouts with stretches, a lack of options, unrealistic goals and stretches too difficult for the average person. </p>

          <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p> User personas were created for the target audience: people who want to stretch, but don’t have a lot of time and aren’t sure what stretches are best. The personas were of a mom with grown kids who need to stretch for health reasons, a
            triathlon who wants to stretch after workouts to reduce soreness and a casual gym user who wants to learn a few new stretches. All the personas wanted to increase their flexibility, but at the moment found it difficult for a variety of
            reasons. </p>

          <h2>User Stories and User Flows</h2>

          <p>When writing the user stories, it became apparent that the high priority actions were: to quickly find a stretch by body region/part, pictures/video/gif, written instructions, multiple routines per target area, a timer so you know how
            long to stretch, and to be able to edit that timer. </p>
          <br>
          <p>User flows were then created for those priorities and other MVP needs like new user-flows, saving favorite routines and creating an account. </p>

          <h2>Wirefreames and Mockups</h2>

          <p> Wireframes were sketched out based on those flows. One change was removing the option to flip the body diagram from front to back. That was removed and the regions edited because there’s plenty of stretches that work the front and back of the body at once.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The dashboard was updated with color strips over the body that are buttons. This made the design more unique looking and easier to "point and click” at what you need. I also played around with color, adding some linear greens to add more style to the mockups.</p>

        <article class="mood">
          <p> The colors are green and white, green to represent growth because as users become more flexible with the app they feel as if they are lengthening and growing in new directions. It’s also green to represent the balancing and harmonizing
            effect that stretching can have on your body and mind if you take the time to focus on it. The fonts used was Poppins because it’s easy to read, playful, and modern.

          <p> The prototype was tested with 3 users and the testing went very well. Everyone was able to quickly enlarge the photos, mute, add favorites, play, pause, add time, and create an account. A couple of users experienced confusion with the
            “walk thru” screens for new users. One user had issues with a start button that was at the bottom of the card. </p>

          <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
          <p> Preference tests were done on any edits to the design. 71% preferred the timer controls that expanded on the whole screen. Another test compared the old start button with a new one and 53% preferred the original design. So it was
            changed so that the whole card could be a button to start the stretches.</p>

      <article class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The problem was solved by creating an app that appealed to everyone and didn't require you to know the anatomical names of the area you want to stretch. This was done with a intuitive dashboard screen with a "point and click" ease of use and basic stretching routines. Iterative work on the timer controls and "walk thru" screens improved the design and made it more user centric.   </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Some doubts when going into the project came when doing a competitive analysis and the first app that was critiqued was very impressive. Almost derailing the project. However, a closer look revealed that it lacked options and it combined workouts with stretches. Bendable was a great lesson on looking thoroughly before thinking something is perfect or can’t be improved.
