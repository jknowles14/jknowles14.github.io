          <h3>Case Study</h3>
          <h1>Bendable</h1>
          <p> Problem: Most people say that they would like to stretch more, but apps currently on the market are made for people with advanced flexibility, lack focus by combining stretches and workouts, or expect the user to commit a lot of time.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            Solution: "Bendable" allows you to just point and "click" where you want to stretch. It includes multiple routines per body region and short routines that people actually have time for.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>Three highly rated stretching apps were compared: “Stretching Exercise App”, “Splits in 30 days”, and “StretchIt”. All three took a very different approach. The combined strengths of these apps include: teaching the stretch with
            thorough
            instruction, strong social media pages, challenging stretches and focusing on one goal. Weaknesses include: combining workouts with stretches, a lack of options, unrealistic goals and stretches too difficult for the average person. </p>

          <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p> User personas were created for the target audience: people who want to stretch, but don’t have a lot of time and aren’t sure what stretches are best. The personas were of a mom who needs to stretch for health reasons, a
            triathlon who wants to stretch after workouts to reduce soreness and a casual gym user who wants to learn a few new stretches. All the personas wanted to increase their flexibility, but at the moment found it difficult for a variety of
            reasons. </p>

          <h2>User Stories and User Flows</h2>

          <p>When writing the user stories, it became apparent that the high priority actions were: to quickly find a stretch by body region/part, pictures/video/gif, written instructions, multiple routines per target area, a timer so you know how
            long to stretch, and to be able to edit that timer. </p>
          <br>
          <p>User flows were then created for those priorities and other MVP needs like new user-flows, saving favorite routines and creating an account. </p>

          <h2>Wireframes and Mockups</h2>

          <p> Wireframes were sketched out based on those flows. One change made was removing the option to flip the body diagram from front to back. That was removed and the regions edited because there’s plenty of stretches that work the front and
            back of the body at once.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The dashboard was updated with color strips over the body to create buttons. This made the design more unique looking and easier to "point and click” at what you need. I also played around with color, adding some linear greens to add
            more style to the mockups.</p>

          <p> The colors are green and white, green to represent growth because as users become more flexible with the app they feel as if they are lengthening and growing in new directions. It’s also green to represent the balancing and harmonizing
            effect that stretching can have on your body and mind if you take the time to focus on it. The font used was Poppins because it’s easy to read, playful, and modern.

          <p> Preference tests were done on any edits to the design. 71% preferred the timer controls that expanded on the whole screen. Also, during the user testing, one user had issues with a start button that was at the bottom of the card. The
            next preference test compared the "old" start button with a "new" one and 53% preferred the original design. Now
            the whole card can be pressed to start the stretches instead of just the buttom.</p>

      <article class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The problem was solved by creating an app that appealed to everyone and didn't require you to know the anatomical names of the area you want to stretch. This was done a "point and click" dashboard and basic stretching routines. Iterative
          work on the timer controls and "walk through" screens improved the design to make it more user-centric. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Some doubts when going into the project came when doing a competitive analysis and the first app that was critiqued was very impressive. This almost derailed the project. However, a closer look revealed that it lacked options and it
          combined
          workouts with stretches. Bendable was a great lesson on looking thoroughly before thinking something is perfect or can’t be improved.
