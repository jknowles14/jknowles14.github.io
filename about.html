          <p> One of my early memories is of the women in my family making jewelry together. This is when I first began to learn how to design. The design of your jewelry is influenced by a lot of factors and it doesn’t work if you don’t consider
            your
            audience. What is the size of the user’s neck? That affects how the necklace will fall. Are they wearing this to a fancy party or to school? That affects the beads (and the rhinestones when you’re a little girl) you choose. Even the
            neckline
            of the shirt or dress needs to be considered. </p>

        <div class="college">
          <p> In college, I switched majors a few times and ended up in filmmaking. I loved coming up with stories and finding the best way to depict those stories visually. I later found that storyboarding scripts and wireframing have a lot in
            common. Both help you plan the layout and solve problems in a format that’s simple to adjust before making big commitments. I didn’t stay in the film industry though, instead I decided to move halfway across the country to gain different
            experiences.</p>

          <p> I found administrative work in health advocacy nonprofits. I unknowingly gained skills in design like how to create Facebook ads to attract volunteers and making simple fact sheets to explain complicated legislation. I also learned to
            anticipate the needs of our volunteers and to voice the needs of people who are often overlooked. When your volunteers have an assortment of different health issues you need to carefully consider your event venue (elevator access) and
            food
            choices (low salt and healthy) and your blog post images need alt text. There’s a lot of needs to consider. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="love">
          <p>What I love about design is that I can use it to improve the lives of the users without them even knowing it. With intuitive design systems, users can quickly take simple steps to complete the needed actions. It’s also amazing the
            way great design can draw someone in, like a beacon, they can’t help but go towards it. I enjoy that with design, I can continue my career of improving people’s lives, while at the same time, create something captivating. </p>
