          <p> <strong> Problem </strong> - </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p> At the “Washington and State” bus stop, there are seven bus routes serving the same bus stop. Riders are complaining about the overly congested bus stop and confusion about when their bus arrives. </p>

          <p> <strong> Solution </strong> - </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p> To show you all seven buses that will be stopping at the “Washington and State” bus stop, what time they get there, and where they are going. Now riders will know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the
            bus stop.</p>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>A competitive analysis was done on the transit apps: Google Maps and Moovit. Google Maps has the advantage of offering more services. They create their own maps and have popular destinations to recommend. However, it have a focus and is
            best at driving directions. That’s where Moovit has the advantage, it’s focused on public transit commuters and their needs. For example, providing bike-share options that will add the location of pick up and drop off points into the
            directions. </p>

          <p> The original versions had the map screen, but the map was moved to another screen so that users could more easily see all the buses stopping at “Wahington and State”. Extra wording was also removed and a star was added next user’s bus.

          <p>The early medium-fidelity versions had a colorful background instead of a white background. This was changed based on feedback that color should be used judiciously for communication purposes only, especially in a mobile environment.
            The star was moved to the right side so the user could see route times first. </p>
